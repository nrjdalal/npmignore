## What is npmignore?

npmignore - search engine for npm but on steroids

- Fully open source and free to use
- View the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/nrjdalal/npmignore).

## Why shouldn't I use npm?

- npm is slow and not mobile friendly
- npm has a limit of 20 results per page
- Exact match is not always the first result
- No custom sorting like by dependents, downloads, last updated

## Features

- Dark mode, come on it's 2024
- Full responsive and faster than npm
- 100 results per page (instead of 20 by npm)
- More results in view without npm's breaking layout
- Sometimes exact match is not the first result, but it is here

## Tasks

- [ ] Add npm default sorting and include pagination
- [ ] Custom sorting (by dependents, downloads, last updated)
- [ ] Title match (package name should contain the search query)
- [ ] Exclude filters (like older packages, number of dependents or downloads)
